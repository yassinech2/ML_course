    Generate a minibatch iterator for a dataset.
    Takes as input two iterables (here the output desired values 'y' and the input data 'tx')
    Outputs an iterator which gives mini-batches of `batch_size` matching elements from `y` and `tx`.
    Data can be randomly shuffled to avoid ordering in the original data messing with the randomness of the minibatches.

    Example:

     Number of batches = 9

     Batch size = 7                              Remainder = 3
     v     v                                         v v
    |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---|
        0       7       14      21      28      35   max batches = 6

    If shuffle is False, the returned batches are the ones started from the indexes:
    0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 0, 7, 14

    If shuffle is True, the returned batches start in:
    7, 28, 14, 35, 14, 0, 21, 28, 7

    To prevent the remainder datapoints from ever being taken into account, each of the shuffled indexes is added a random amount
    8, 28, 16, 38, 14, 0, 22, 28, 9

    This way batches might overlap, but the returned batches are slightly more representative.

    Disclaimer: To keep this function simple, individual datapoints are not shuffled. For a more random result consider using a batch_size of 1.

    Example of use :
    for minibatch_y, minibatch_tx in batch_iter(y, tx, 32):
        <DO-SOMETHING>
